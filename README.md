# Description

This is an online ticket booking platform for live music events in Australia. The application features:

    An Administrator overseeing venue management and all system users.
    Event Planners who list and manage their events. They can adjust event details and ticket prices.
    Customers who search and book tickets, either by act name or through a 6-month calendar view.
    Venues, managed by the Administrator, have various sections like mosh and VIP, with prices varying by section and artist. 
No payment system is integrated; simply reserving a ticket confirms a booking.



# Instructions for Github documentation
## Part 1
    * Use Case Diagram: Illustrates interactions between actors and use cases, including relevant relationships. Available in the report within docs/part1.
    * Use Case Descriptions: Each use case is detailed with associated actors and a high-level description, in line with Appendix E – Simplified use cases.
    * Domain Model: A representation of the application's core entities and their relationships. Accompanied by a descriptive explanation.
    * Report: Our detailed report, including the aforementioned elements, can be found here.

Submission:

    * The report is available in the docs/part1 directory of our GitHub repository.
    * Please refer to the Canvas assignments for the Part1A checklist (Appendix A – Checklist for Part1 Deliverable).

## Part 3
Task:
In this part you will design and implement your app as described in Application Domain and as defined
by the use cases identified in Part 1 (the use cases are specific to each team and project and must be
approved by the teaching team). At this stage, you will assume that your application is only accessed
by one user at a time (i.e., there is no need to handle concurrency yet).
You must include the following patterns in your design and implementation (see Appendix F –
Expanded use cases and Appendix G – Architecture Document for more details):
• Domain model
• Data mapper
• Unit of work
• Lazy load
• Identity field
• Foreign key mapping
• Association table mapping
• Embedded value
• One of the inheritance patterns
• Authentication and Authorization (you are free to use any library/framework to implement
these patterns)
Deliverables:
1. The application coded and deployed. The source code of your application and updated
documents must be committed to your Git repository. The application must be deployed in
Render.
2. You must create a tag in your Git repository for this deliverable in the following format:
SWEN90007_2023_Part2_<team name>. The tag must be created before the submission
deadline as this will be used to assess your deliverable (no exceptions). After creating the
release tag, you deploy this tag (not your main repository branch).
3. A Software Architecture Design (SAD) report with the following items:
• The class diagram of your application.


## Part 4
* We completed high fidelity, 
* Introduced how to use high fidelity to customers, this is our acceptance tests. Then we received feedback from customers, and upgraded high fidelity based on the feedback.
* Create the mood board. 
* We made the slide and finished the final presentation.
