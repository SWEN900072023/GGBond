# Description
The project is to develop software/pipeline/database that can generate participation data that represents the level of participation a student has in a subjectâ€™s activities and materials. The software can improve student engagement at university by supporting the development of regular wrap-up style feedback for students, which could help students work with reflective exercises to encourage self awareness of and improvement to participation and engagement at university.
