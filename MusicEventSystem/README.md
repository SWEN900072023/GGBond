# Description

This is an online ticket booking platform for live music events in Australia. The application features:

* An Administrator overseeing venue management and all system users.
* Event Planners who list and manage their events. They can adjust event details and ticket prices.
* Customers who search and book tickets, either by act name or through a 6-month calendar view.
* Venues, managed by the Administrator, have various sections like mosh and VIP, with prices varying by section and artist. 
No payment system is integrated; simply reserving a ticket confirms a booking.
